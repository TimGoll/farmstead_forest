§lWelcome to Farmstead Forest§r

This modback vastly changes the overall game progression. But there are plenty of advancements to help you from getting lost. Press §lV§r to open the advancement tree.

Additionally there is a guidebook which explains the basics of everything. You should look into it to learn how to play.

You can skill your character with levels. As soon as you reach level 5, you're able to open a new interface with the §lL§r key and select a profession.

If you encounter any bugs or problems please report them on GitHub. There's a link in your guidebook and in the main menu. Have fun!
